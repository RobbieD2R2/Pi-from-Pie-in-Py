# Pi-from-Pie-in-Py
A visual demonstration of Pi (3.14) by simulating darts randomly thrown at a dartboard


Pi Day is on March 14th. There are lots of mentions about it on social media, but not enough demonstrations or explanations of what Pi can actually be made to represent.  It's a learning opportnity!

This repo is really just a simple Python program that makes use of a graphics wrapper - simple enough, by design, so that I can use it in my Intro course.

The idea is that, if a circle is placed inside a square, and you randomly threw darts at the square, then the ratio of darts that would land inside the circle versus outside the circle is - wait for it - 3.14 out of 4.

PI!

Please feel free to use this for an in-class demonstration as it is, or to fork it and improve upon it.  If you're doing an in-class demo, I would recommend keeping the Terminal window open full-screen while the graphical window generated by the program can be dragged to the right-side of the screen.  That way students can see both the darts at the dartboard as well as the numerical Pi calculation as it develops.
